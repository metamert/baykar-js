# Baykar Web Front-End Developer JavaScript Quiz Application Task
## Note to evaluator
Due to my current commitments at another company and weekly work schedule, I could only complete the JavaScript task. I deeply regret any inconvenience this might have caused. I promise that this situation is solely my responsibility and my mistake. I hope that, without infringing on anyone else's rights, I can still find the opportunity to work at Baykar.

## About the project
This project is a JavaScript quiz application built as a task for the position of Web Front-End Developer at Baykar.

Please Note: Due to the JSON object not being entirely suitable for a quiz application, I had to use an ID converter to handle the IDs. I believe this was a requirement you expected. Moreover, for security reasons, I imitated an asynchronous request when getting the answers.

## Tech Stack

#### Thank you! 
Thank you for giving me this opportunity, I hope you like my task. If you have any other questions on this matter, please do not hesitate to notify me.
